### **Jun 16<sup>th</sup> - Jun 19<sup>th</sup> 2026** REMIND-MAgPIE26 workshop & stories

After our [MAgPIE] training workshops in the last years, this year we will host a special combined REMIND-MAgPIE edition. The workshop and stories event is scheduled from **Jun 16<sup>th</sup> to Jun 19<sup>th</sup> 2026**, please save the date. Like the last two MAgPIE workshops we plan to organize the event in hybrid allowing virtual as well as physical participation at the event. Event location will be again at the Telegrafenberg in [Potsdam at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)](http://pik-potsdam.de).

The workshop will be preceded by a virtual pre event to help with the installation of the required tools and will be based on the [MAgPIE](../../../../tutorials) and [REMIND tutorials] available online and presented by various members of the development teams, giving you the opportunity to not only getting to know the models but also the teams behind it. Sessions will address different levels of experience from absolute beginners to more experienced REMIND & MAgPIE users and participants are encouraged to select sessions based on their own experience level and interest.

Like in previous [MAgPIE] events the workshop is planned to be mixed with **REMIND & MAgPIE stories** sessions. These sessions will address the continuously increasing community of REMIND & MAgPIE developers and users around the world by creating a room to present own work and experiences around the models. A **call for contributions** will be published in advance for which we would like to encourage everyone to submit their current work, plans, struggles or success stories around the model. The registration for the workshop will open within the next days.
