Welcome to the homepage for the REMIND-MAgPIE 26 workshop which will take place from **16th to 19th of June 2026**.

This year our workshop & stories event will happen as a combined REMIND-MAgPIE workshop over 4 days in mid-June 2026. Similar to last year, it will take place in a hybrid format, hosted on the Telegrafenberg at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research for on-site participants, while online participants will join via Zoom. During the first 3 days of the event, we will have an introduction workshop for the REMIND and MAgPIE models and the underlying MADRaT data processing framework with deep dives into the models happening in two parallel tracks, as well as two REMIND & MAgPIE stories sessions where current users and developers of the model present their most recent work. Day 4 will then focus on the REMIND-MAgPIE model coupling.

The registration will be open from mid February until **May 31st** (or earlier if all tickets are taken earlier).
